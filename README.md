# Personal-Site


 Essentially a fancy online resume, this site does an especially good job of incorporating graphics and color in a super classy way.
 
 
 This “interactive resume” uses color blocks to break up the one-page site and make it easier to skim, and the images seriously up the excitement factor. 
 It’s a perfect hybrid between a traditional resume and an online site.
